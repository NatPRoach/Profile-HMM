Profile Hidden Markov Model for MSA

This repository contains a Python3.5 module for creating a profile HMM from a
MSA presented in fasta format. The class supports scoring testdata against the
created model (with multicore support) or just prints out statistical
information about the MSA alignment. The depth of these information should be
improved tough.

The usage is very simple and can be looked up via invoking python3 main.py -h.

Dependencies are Numpy and Numba.
